# 🛠️ Codex Tools Guide: Building AI-Powered Tools Made Easy!

**Date:** June 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete guide to using Codex tools for building AI assistants  
**Project:** Codex Agent Computer System  
**Directory:** `/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/docs/`

## 🎯 What is This? (Explain Like I'm 12)

Imagine you have a **magic robot friend** that can build entire computer programs for you! That's what Codex tools do. You just tell the robot "I want a tool that does X, Y, and Z" and POOF! 🪄 It creates:

- ✨ A complete working program
- 📖 Instructions on how to use it
- 🏠 A home on GitHub where others can see it
- 🖥️ A cloud computer where you can work on it
- 🤖 Smart suggestions while you code

**Think of it like:** Having a super-smart friend who can build LEGO castles, but instead of LEGO blocks, they use computer code!

## 🧠 How This Fits Into Agent Computer Systems

### What's an Agent Computer System?

An **Agent Computer System** is like having a team of robot assistants that work together:

1. **🤖 Planning Agent** - Thinks about what to build
2. **⚡ Building Agent** - Actually creates the code
3. **🧪 Testing Agent** - Makes sure everything works
4. **📦 Deployment Agent** - Puts it online for everyone to use
5. **📚 Documentation Agent** - Writes instructions

### How Codex Tools Fit In:

```
You Say: "I want a calculator app"
    ↓
Planning Agent: "I'll design a calculator with buttons and math"
    ↓
Building Agent: "I'll write the code using JavaScript and HTML"
    ↓
Testing Agent: "Let me check if 2+2=4 works correctly"
    ↓
Deployment Agent: "I'll put it on GitHub and make it live"
    ↓
Documentation Agent: "Here's how to use your new calculator!"
```

## 📂 File Organization

Your tools are now organized like a clean bedroom:

```
~/code/codex/
├── tools/                    # 🛠️ Your magic tool builders
│   └── tool-builder.sh      # The main magic wand script
├── docs/                    # 📚 All the instruction manuals
│   └── CODEX_TOOLS_GUIDE.md # This guide you're reading!
└── [existing codex files]   # The robot's brain files
```

**Why organize like this?**

- 🎯 Easy to find everything
- 🧹 Keeps your computer clean
- 🤝 Easy to share with friends
- 🔄 Easy to backup and sync

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions (Never Forget Edition!)

### Step 1: Check Your Magic Powers (Prerequisites)

Before using the magic wand, make sure you have all the spell components:

```bash
# Check if you have all the magic ingredients:
which codex gh curl jq git
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY | cut -c1-10
```

**If any are missing:**

- **codex**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/codex-cli`
- **gh**: `brew install gh` (then run `gh auth login`)
- **curl & jq**: Already on your Mac!
- **git**: Already on your Mac!
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Get from OpenAI website, add to your shell config

### Step 2: Cast the Spell (Run the Tool Builder)

```bash
# The magic command format:
/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh TOOL_NAME "DESCRIPTION"

# Real example:
/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh mycalc "calculates math problems with a pretty interface"
```

### Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen! ✨

The script will:

1. 🧠 **Think** - Ask ChatGPT to design your tool
2. 🏗️ **Build** - Use Codex to create the code
3. 📦 **Package** - Install all needed parts
4. 🌐 **Publish** - Create a GitHub repository
5. ☁️ **Deploy** - Set up a cloud workspace
6. 🖥️ **Launch** - Open everything in your browser

### Step 4: Start Coding in the Cloud!

- Your new tool opens in **GitHub Codespaces** (cloud computer)
- **GitHub Copilot** helps you write code (AI pair programmer)
- Everything is saved automatically to GitHub

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Calculator

```bash
/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh simple-calc "adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides numbers with a web interface"
```

### Example 2: Todo List App

```bash
/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh my-todos "manages daily tasks with add, complete, and delete features"
```

### Example 3: Weather Dashboard

```bash
/Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh weather-dash "shows current weather and 5-day forecast for any city"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting (When Magic Goes Wrong)

### Problem: "Command not found: codex"

**Solution:** Install Codex CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/codex-cli
```

### Problem: "Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not set"

**Solution:** Add your API key to your shell:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Problem: "gh: command not found"

**Solution:** Install GitHub CLI:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

### Problem: Script says "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x /Users/chrisdavis/code/codex/tools/tool-builder.sh
```

## 🎓 Advanced Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Agent Workflow

```bash
# Create a planning tool
./tool-builder.sh project-planner "breaks down big projects into small tasks"

# Create a coding tool
./tool-builder.sh code-generator "writes code based on specifications"

# Create a testing tool
./tool-builder.sh test-runner "automatically tests code and reports results"
```

### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Assistants

```bash
# Data Science Assistant
./tool-builder.sh data-wizard "analyzes CSV files and creates visualizations"

# Web Development Assistant
./tool-builder.sh web-builder "creates responsive websites with modern frameworks"

# DevOps Assistant
./tool-builder.sh deploy-helper "automates deployment to cloud platforms"
```
