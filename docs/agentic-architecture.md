# Agentic Computer System Architecture

**A Comprehensive Guide to Building Autonomous Development Environments**

## 🧠 Introduction to Agentic Computing

An agentic computer system represents the next evolution in autonomous computing - systems that can reason, plan, execute tasks, and continuously improve themselves without human intervention. This architecture document outlines how the Codex CLI ecosystem has been enhanced with the `tool-builder.sh` system to create a self-improving, autonomous development environment.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### Systems-Based Software Development (SBSD)

Our approach follows Systems-Based Software Development principles:

- **Holistic System Perspective**: Software as part of larger socio-technical systems
- **Interface-First Design**: Clear component boundaries and contracts
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-managing and self-improving capabilities
- **Emergent Intelligence**: System-level behavior emerging from component interactions

### Agentic Principles

1. **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently with minimal human oversight
2. **Reactivity**: Respond to environmental changes and events
3. **Proactivity**: Take initiative to achieve goals
4. **Social Ability**: Communicate and collaborate with other agents
5. **Learning**: Continuously improve through experience
